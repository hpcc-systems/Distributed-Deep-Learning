# System Requirements

The examples in this project require the pyembed plugin and Python to be installed on every machine in the system. Python version 2.7 has been tested, but Python 3.x should work with little to no modifications. In addition, there are several python packages that are required for use, the main libraries (and any of their included dependencies) are:

Markup : * TensorFlow (only cpu installation has been tested)
 * Keras.io
 * numpy
 * pandas
 * h5py 

A full list of python packages of the system the examples were tested on can be found below
